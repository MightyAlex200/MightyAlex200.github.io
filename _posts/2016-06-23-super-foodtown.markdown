Okay so I did a do and made a game called "Super FoodTown"

TBH I didn't know what I was doing, it was my first truly completed game made in love2d and also my first game made in moonscript

The Windows binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/MightyAlex200/Super-FoodTown/releases), but for everybody else just grab a copy of Love over [here](https://www.love2d.org/) and zip up the "comp" folder in [the repository](https://github.com/MightyAlex200/Super-FoodTown) and just rename it from a .zip to a .love file.

I don't even know why I made it actually. It's really weird.
